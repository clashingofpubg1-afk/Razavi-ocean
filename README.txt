Starter Portfolio Template — files included:
- index.html
- styles.css
- script.js

How to use:
1) Extract files and edit index.html to replace name/email/github links and project details.
2) To host on GitHub Pages:
   - Create a new public repository on GitHub.
   - Upload these files to the repo root (Add file -> Upload files).
   - Go to Settings -> Pages -> Source: Deploy from a branch -> Branch: main -> Folder: / (root) -> Save.
   - Wait 1-2 minutes and open https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/

If you want, I can customize the template with your name, projects, and GitHub repo ready — tell me which details to fill.
